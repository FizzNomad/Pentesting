This script is designed to test web applications for the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. 
It contains functions to check for the presence of required dependencies and prompts the user to skip tests if any are missing.

The script includes tests for the following vulnerabilities:

Injection flaws (SQL and NoSQL Injection, OS Command Injection, Code Injection)
Broken authentication and session management (Session Management, Password Cracking)
Cross-site scripting (XSS)
Insecure direct object references
Security misconfiguration (Web Application Fingerprinting, Server Fingerprinting)
Insecure cryptographic storage (SSL/TLS Testing)
Insufficient transport layer protection (HTTPS Testing, MITM Proxy test)
Broken access controls (Authorization Bypass)
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
To use the script, simply run it with ./OWASPit.sh and follow the prompts. If you have a single target URL, you can enter it at the prompt. If you have a file containing a list of URLs, you can specify the file as an argument when running the script.

For each vulnerability test, the script will prompt the user to choose whether to perform the test or skip it. The script will then run the chosen tests and output the results to log files for each test.

Once all tests have completed, the script will output a message indicating that all tests completed successfully.

Note: Please make sure to review the log files carefully and take appropriate actions to address any vulnerabilities that are found
