# Pentesting
I wanted to learn how to automate things I find myself doing regularly so that I can focus on more important tasks.  I suppose inspiration has come from the book "Automate the boring stuff with Python". 

Essentially I am creating my own building blocks or templates I can expand on over time as my knowledge grows.

Unfinished and full of examples and gaps, plenty of ideas to come.
