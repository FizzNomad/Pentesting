## Step-by-step work instruction for using the PowerShell script:

retrieve Active Directory (AD) user accounts created within a specific date range, exclude users from a particular Organizational Unit (OU), and export the filtered results to a CSV file. 
custom property to store the disabled date for users with the 'userAccountControl' property set to indicate the account is disabled.

1. Install the Active Directory module (if not already installed): 
 - Open PowerShell and run the following command to install the Active Directory module:

   `Install-Module -Name ActiveDirectory`

2. Customize the script: Before running the script, make sure to replace `"OU=Disabled Users,DC=yourdomain,DC=com"` 
   in the script with the distinguished name of the Disabled Users OU in your domain.

3. Save the script: Copy the entire script into a plain text file and save it with the file extension .ps1, for example, Export-FilteredUsers.ps1.

4. Run the script:

a. Open PowerShell with administrative privileges. To do this, right-click on the PowerShell icon and select "Run as administrator."

b. Change the current directory to the location where you saved the script. For example, if you saved the script in the C:\Scripts directory, run the following command:

  `Set-Location C:\Scripts`

c. Execute the script by running the following command:

  `.\Export-FilteredUsers.ps1`

   Enter the date range: When prompted, enter the start and end dates for the date range using the format yyyy-MM-dd. For example:

   ```
   Enter the start date (yyyy-MM-dd): 2018-01-01
   Enter the end date (yyyy-MM-dd): 2021-12-31
   ```

5. Review the results: After the script completes, a CSV file named FilteredUsers.csv (or the name specified in the $outputFilePath variable in the script) 
will be created in the same directory as the script. 
Open the file in Microsoft Excel or another CSV-compatible application to review and manipulate the data.
